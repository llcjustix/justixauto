Read the assigned brief and cited rules/contracts only. Write a bounded plan to
the assigned artifact; do not modify application code or canonical records.
Include owned paths, dependencies, acceptance criteria and required product
decisions. Do not invent business policy or create permanent backlog IDs.

Development verification is UNIT TESTS ONLY. Do not add lint, typecheck, builds,
browser/integration tests or automatic review/QA stages to the plan. No mandatory
plan review or extra agent handoffs. Main handles routine work and Git.
Return the plan path, unresolved decisions and next action. No subagents.
