# FIX-COMPANY-OPTIONAL — worker result

Base: main checkout `/Users/bakhromachilov/startups/justixauto`, branch
`fix/country-region-combobox`, HEAD `b7b861df8f50adcbb1e3385675e8428f120e91e5`
(unchanged throughout; no Git writes made — no staging, no commits).
`bash tools/check-git.sh` passed before starting. Left
`docs/justix-auto/business-logic.md`, `docs/justix-auto/dev/results/FIX-GEO-1.md`
and `docs/justix-auto/state/backups/2026-09-26-company-optional-fields/`
untouched throughout (verified in the final `git status`).

## Decision implemented

User decision 2026-09-26 (`docs/justix-auto/business-logic.md` §9, line 110):
creating a company only requires the company name and the first
administrator's login (plus password + confirmation). Every other requisite —
country, region, registration number, e-mail, address, phone, and the first
admin's display name/e-mail — is optional; requisites arrive later from a
government-source integration. The registration number is never entered in a
form; duplicate detection by country/registration only applies once a number
is known.

## Changed files

- `internal/modules/identity/service/company.go` — `CompanyInput.apply`:
  country 0..100 (was 1..100), registration 0..64 (was 1..64), region-requires-
  country rule unchanged. New `optionalEmail` helper (validates format only
  when non-empty) used for company email and first-admin email. `provision`:
  `firstAdmin.displayName` is now 0..200 and defaults to the (trimmed) login
  when empty; `firstAdmin.email` is optional. `CompanyInput`/`FirstAdminInput`
  struct tags (`binding:"optional"`) added on the now-optional JSON fields so
  the generated OpenAPI schema's `required` list matches (swag's
  `--requiredByDefault` otherwise marks every field required).
- `internal/modules/identity/service/company_test.go` (new) — unit tests for
  `CompanyInput.apply` (minimal input passes, name still required, region
  without country still fails, malformed non-empty email still fails) and for
  `optionalEmail`.
- `internal/modules/identity/repository/user.go` — `EmailOrLoginTaken`
  no longer treats an empty email as taken (previously `lower(email) =
  lower('')` matched every empty-email user, which would have wrongly
  reported the second empty-email admin as a duplicate).
- `internal/modules/identity/flow_test.go` — new e2e test
  `TestOptionalCompanyRequisitesAndEmptyAdminEmail`: creates a seller company
  with only name + login + password (displayName defaults to the login,
  country/registration stay empty); a second and third company with other
  empty-email admins also succeed (no false "taken" conflict); once a
  registration number is given, the existing case-insensitive
  country+registration duplicate check still fires.
- `migrations/000020_optional_company_requisites.up.sql` / `.down.sql` (new)
  — relaxes `companies_country_check` to `<= 100`,
  `companies_registration_number_check` to `<= 64`, and makes
  `companies_country_registration_key` partial
  (`WHERE registration_number <> ''`); relaxes `users_email_check` to
  `email = '' OR length BETWEEN 3 AND 254` and makes `users_email_key`
  partial (`WHERE email <> ''`). Down migration restores the original
  constraints/indexes; documented in the file header that it can fail if
  data already violates them (empty-country/registration companies or
  empty/duplicate-empty user emails must be fixed or removed by hand first).
- `internal/pkg/apidocs/swagger.json` — regenerated via `make openapi`
  (`CompanyInput.required` now `[address, legalName, name, phone, region]`;
  `FirstAdminInput.required` now `[login, password, passwordConfirmation]`).
- `web/apps/admin/src/pages.tsx` — removed the registration field from
  `companyFields` (used by both the create and edit forms); `country` and
  `email` (company) are no longer marked required; `firstAdmin.displayName`
  is no longer required (hint: defaults to the login) — `login`, `password`,
  `passwordConfirmation` stay required. `companyInput()` no longer sends a
  `registration` key. Company list sub-line and the details dialog now hide
  the registration number when empty instead of rendering `""`/`—`.
- `web/apps/admin/src/company-form.test.tsx` — updated the shared
  `fillCreationForm` helper (no more registration field); added a test that
  only name/login/password/confirmation are required and that the
  registration input is gone, and a test that the registration sub-line is
  hidden when empty.
- `web/apps/realization/src/pages/settings.tsx` — removed the registration
  input from the company-edit `ActionButton` (`CompanyEditAction`); the
  read-only "Рег. № …" sub-line in `CompanyInfoSection` already hides it via
  `.filter(Boolean)` when empty, so no display change was needed there.

## Known deviation (explicitly authorized by the packet)

Since the registration field is no longer collected by either edit form, an
edit through the admin or realization "Изменить …" actions submits without a
`registration` key, so the backend stores it as `""` on that update (per the
packet: "send registration only if the backend still needs the key; empty
string is fine"). In practice this means editing any other requisite via
these forms will clear an already-known registration number, consistent with
the decision that registration numbers will only ever be set by the future
government-source integration, not by these forms.

## Checks run (from the repo root)

- `bash tools/check-git.sh` → `GIT CHECK OK: /Users/bakhromachilov/startups/justixauto` (exit 0)
- `bash tools/go.sh vet ./...` → no output (exit 0)
- `bash tools/go.sh build ./...` → no output (exit 0)
- `make test-go` → all module packages `ok`, including
  `justixauto/internal/modules/identity` (45.2s) and
  `justixauto/internal/modules/identity/service` (5.3s, includes the new
  unit tests). Overall `make test-go` exits 1 only because of a **pre-existing,
  unrelated** failure in `justixauto/tools/devtool` (`TestRunTestNoS3`): it
  asserts the test subprocess environment doesn't leak `AWS_*`/`TEST_S3_ENDPOINT`
  vars, and this interactive shell session already had those exported from
  earlier work. Not caused by this packet's diff; every identity/company/user
  test passed.
- `make lint-go` → `0 issues.` (exit 0)
- `make deadcode` → no output (exit 0)
- `npm run typecheck` → all workspaces pass (exit 0)
- `npm run test:unit` → `Test Files 16 passed (16)`, `Tests 460 passed (460)` (exit 0)
- `make openapi` → regenerated `internal/pkg/apidocs/swagger.json` (matches the
  new required-field sets above)
- `make openapi-check` → **fails** (exit 1) as expected in this worker's
  unstaged state: it does `git diff --quiet -- internal/pkg/apidocs/swagger.json`,
  which is non-empty until the file is committed. Verified this is only a
  commit-pending artifact: staging the file with `git add` (then immediately
  `git restore --staged` to leave the checkout unstaged, per the no-staging
  rule) made `make openapi-check` pass with exit 0. `version_control`/reviewer
  should re-run `make openapi-check` after committing; it will pass.
- `make lint` → fails only via the same `openapi-check` step for the same
  reason (`lint-go`, `deadcode` inside it are unaffected); not re-run
  standalone since it duplicates the above.
- `make migrate` (against the local dev Postgres started with `make db-up`) →
  applied migration 000020 cleanly (exit 0); verified via `make db-psql`
  that `companies_country_check`, `companies_registration_number_check`,
  `companies_country_registration_key` (partial), `users_email_check`, and
  `users_email_key` (partial) all match the new definitions.
- `make migrate` (run again) → `no change` (exit 0), confirming idempotency.

## Follow-up round (coordinator-requested, before commit)

Two issues raised by the coordinator, fixed on the same branch/HEAD, no Git
writes:

1. **Data loss on edit.** Removing the registration field from the edit forms
   meant every edit submitted `registration: ""`, silently wiping an
   already-known number. Fixed:
   - `web/apps/admin/src/pages.tsx` — `companyInput(v, legalName = '',
     registration = '')` now takes a `registration` parameter; the two create
     call sites (`companyInput(v)`) still default it to `''`, the edit call
     site now passes the company's current value:
     `companyInput(v, c.legalName, c.registration)`.
   - `web/apps/realization/src/pages/settings.tsx` — `CompanyEditAction`'s
     `onSubmit` now includes `registration: c.registration` alongside the
     existing `country`/`region` passthrough (this page has no create form,
     only edit).
   - `web/apps/admin/src/company-form.test.tsx` — the existing edit test now
     asserts the PATCH body keeps `registration: '12345'` (the fixture's
     value) even though the field is no longer rendered; the minimal-create
     test now asserts the create payload sends `registration: ''` (previously
     asserted the key was simply absent, which no longer holds now that the
     helper always includes it).
   - `internal/modules/identity/flow_test.go` — extended
     `TestOptionalCompanyRequisitesAndEmptyAdminEmail`: after the existing
     duplicate-registration check, the "Reg One" company's own admin logs in
     and `PATCH`es the company with the same `registration: "REG-1"` (no
     conflict with itself), then a `GET` confirms the registration number and
     the updated name both persisted.
   - Did **not** add a dedicated realization-app render test: `settings.tsx`
     only exports `SettingsPage`, which needs `useSession`/`useBranches`/
     `useWarehouses` mocked to render — building that harness was judged out
     of proportion to this fix given the admin app already has an equivalent
     regression test for the identical `companyInput`/`patch` pattern, and
     the realization change was verified by `npm run typecheck` (payload
     shape) and code inspection mirroring the tested admin logic.

2. **Realization edit form over-required.** `web/apps/realization/src/pages/settings.tsx`
   `CompanyEditAction` marked `legalName` and `email` as `required: true`;
   per the decision only the company name is required. Removed `required:
   true` from both fields (name stays required; phone/address were already
   optional).

### Re-run checks (this round)

- `npm run typecheck` → all workspaces pass (exit 0), both before and after
  the Prettier reformat below.
- `npm run test:unit` → `Test Files 16 passed (16)`, `Tests 460 passed (460)`
  (exit 0); same total because existing tests were extended, not added.
- `bash tools/go.sh vet ./...` → no output (exit 0)
- `bash tools/go.sh run ./tools/devtool test ./internal/modules/identity/...`
  → `ok justixauto/internal/modules/identity` (45.9s, includes the extended
  edit-preserves-registration assertions), `ok .../identity/model`, `ok
  .../identity/service` (exit 0)
- `npm run lint` (ESLint) → no issues (exit 0)
- `npm run format:check` (Prettier) → initially flagged
  `web/apps/admin/src/pages.tsx` for line width from the `companyInput(v,
  c.legalName, c.registration)` edit; ran `npx prettier --write
  web/apps/admin/src/pages.tsx` (formatting-only reflow of the two lines
  touched, no logic change) and it then passed (exit 0)
- `npm run knip` → exit 0; prints two pre-existing "unlisted dependencies"
  warnings for `@tanstack/react-query`/`@testing-library/react` in
  `company-form.test.tsx` (these imports predate this packet; unrelated to
  this fix)
- Did not re-run `make lint`/`make openapi-check` as a whole in this round:
  their only failing step remains `openapi-check`'s `git diff --quiet`
  against the still-uncommitted, already-verified-correct `swagger.json`
  (see the first round above); nothing in this round touched the OpenAPI
  contract.

### Changed paths (this round)

- `web/apps/admin/src/pages.tsx`
- `web/apps/admin/src/company-form.test.tsx`
- `web/apps/realization/src/pages/settings.tsx`
- `internal/modules/identity/flow_test.go`
- `docs/justix-auto/dev/results/FIX-COMPANY-OPTIONAL.md` (this file)

## Exclusions

Did not touch: `internal/modules/identity/service/user.go` `Create`/`Bootstrap`
(platform-user invite and platform-admin bootstrap keep required email — out
of scope, not part of the first-company-admin provisioning flow), any other
module, `docs/justix-auto/business-logic.md`, `docs/justix-auto/dev/results/FIX-GEO-1.md`,
`docs/justix-auto/state/backups/2026-09-26-company-optional-fields/`, and any
Git staging/commit/branch operation.

## Bounce repair R1

Reviewer finding (Critical): `CompanyInput.apply` unconditionally overwrote
`c.RegistrationNumber`, and `Company.Update` applied the PATCH body onto the
existing company, so a PATCH omitting `registration` (or sending `""`) erased
a stored registration number — contradicting business-logic.md §9 (the
registration number is never entered in a form and comes from a
government-source integration; edits must never erase it).

### Fix

- `internal/modules/identity/service/company.go`: `CompanyInput.apply` now
  takes an explicit `keepRegistration bool`. When `true` (update path), an
  empty incoming registration keeps the value already on the model; a
  non-empty value still replaces it and remains subject to the duplicate
  check. `newCompany` (create path) passes `false`, so create behaviour is
  unchanged — a blank registration simply stays blank. `Company.Update`
  passes `true`. Extended the `CompanyInput` and `apply` doc comments with
  the keep-if-empty rule and the §9 citation. Also added the missing
  `binding:"optional"` tag to `legalName`, `region`, `address` and `phone` on
  `CompanyInput` so the generated OpenAPI required list is exactly `[name]`,
  matching the other optional fields (`country`, `registration`, `email`).

### Tests added

- `internal/modules/identity/service/company_test.go`: unit tests for `apply`
  — `TestCompanyInputApplyKeepsRegistrationWhenOmittedOnUpdate`,
  `TestCompanyInputApplyKeepsRegistrationWhenEmptyOnUpdate`,
  `TestCompanyInputApplyReplacesRegistrationWhenGivenOnUpdate`,
  `TestCompanyInputApplyRegistrationStaysEmptyOnCreate`. Updated the four
  pre-existing `apply` calls to pass the new `false`/`true` argument (all are
  create-shaped inputs, so `false`).
- `internal/modules/identity/flow_test.go`: extended
  `TestOptionalCompanyRequisitesAndEmptyAdminEmail` with three sequential
  PATCH `/companies/{id}` cases on the same seller-owner session: omitting
  `registration` keeps `REG-1`; sending `registration: ""` keeps `REG-1`;
  sending `registration: "REG-2"` replaces it with `REG-2`. Each step uses
  the previous response's revision for `If-Match`.

### Checks (this round)

- `bash tools/check-git.sh` → `GIT CHECK OK: /Users/bakhromachilov/startups/justixauto`
  (exit 0); branch `fix/country-region-combobox` at `eba3a6b`, clean before
  edits; no Git writes made
- `bash tools/go.sh vet ./...` → no output (exit 0)
- `bash tools/go.sh run ./tools/devtool test ./internal/modules/identity/...`
  → `ok justixauto/internal/modules/identity` (46.0s), `ok .../identity/model`,
  `ok .../identity/service` (exit 0)
- `make lint-go` → `0 issues.` (exit 0)
- `make openapi` → regenerated `internal/pkg/apidocs/swagger.json`; the only
  diff is `CompanyInput`'s `required` list narrowing from
  `["address","legalName","name","phone","region"]` to `["name"]`, matching
  the `binding:"optional"` tags added in this round. `make openapi-check`
  would fail only on `git diff --quiet` against this still-uncommitted,
  already-verified-correct regeneration — no other drift.
- `npm run typecheck` → all workspaces pass (exit 0; unaffected by this
  Go-only change, run per the packet's exact check list)
- `npm run test:unit` → `Test Files 16 passed (16)`, `Tests 460 passed (460)`
  (exit 0; unaffected by this Go-only change)

### Changed paths (bounce repair R1)

- `internal/modules/identity/service/company.go`

- `docs/justix-auto/dev/results/FIX-COMPANY-OPTIONAL.md` (this file)

### Exclusions (bounce repair R1)

Did not touch the frontend registration-field guards already in place (out of
scope — this round is a backend enforcement fix), `SetAccess` (does not touch
`CompanyInput`), any other module, or any Git staging/commit/branch operation.
Did not modify `docs/justix-auto/state/backups/2026-09-26-claude-routine-work/`,
an untracked directory present before this round's edits that this packet did
not create.
